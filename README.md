# Production-Support-Log
This is a sample web application to log and manage Production Support issues.

I took on this project from a tutorial from CodingTheSmartWay.com, I wanted to make a fully functional web application using Pure Javascript. 

The tutorial was excellent but it wasn't working straight away which gave me more experience looking at and debugging my code.
